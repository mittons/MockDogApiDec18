# MockDogApiDec18
# About Project
This project is just a skill consolidation/refining project meant for training myself.

It mocks one endpoint of dog api with a small portion of its data set.

The current project is written to be used by the practice project [DoggoDec18](https://www.github.com/mittons/DoggoDec18) (and possibly future iterations of that project).
